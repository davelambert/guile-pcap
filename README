libpcap.

Suggestions, bug reports, and general complaints should go to me, Dave

Installation
____________

See the file INSTALL for generic installation help.

I have only tested guile-pcap with Guile 1.6.2 and 1.6.4.

You will, of course, require libpcap.  I have used 0.7.1 and 0.8.3.

Usage
-----

From Guile, just

     guile> (use-modules (net pcap))

And you now have access to all the (relevant) functions from pcap.h.
